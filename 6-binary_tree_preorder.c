 * binary_tree_preorder - Performs a preorder traversal on a binary tree,

 * @tree: Pointer to the root node of the binary tree to be traversed.
 * @func: Pointer to the function to be applied to each node during traversal
 *
 * This function performs a recursive preorder traversal on the binary tree
 * rooted at the given node. For each node, the specified function 'func' is
 * applied, allowing users to perform custom actions on the values of the nodes
 * The traversal is halted if the input tree or function is NULL.
 *
 * @tree: Pointer to the root node of the binary tree to be traversed.
 * @func: Pointer to the function to be applied to each node during traversal
